								"At the end of a long breather, A character who makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom({@skill Medicine}) check can spend one or more Hit Dice, up to half the character's maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level. Expending one use of a {@item Healer's Kit|phb} grants advantage on this check. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. After applying your Constitution modifier to a Hit Die roll, you regain a minimum of 0 hit points. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a short or long rest, as explained below. Additionally spellcasters regain up to half of their maximum spell slots(rounded down), but none of the slots recovered may be of 6th-level or higher.",

If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity— such as walking, fighting, expending spell slots, or similar adventuring activity, the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.",
								"At the end of a short rest, a character regains hit points equal to their level plus their Constitution modifier(minimum of one hit point). Additionally, a character who makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom({@skill Medicine}) check regains spent Hit Dice, up to half the character's total number of them(minimum of one Hit Die). Expending one use of a {@item Healer's Kit|phb} grants advantage on this check.",

If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity— such as walking, fighting, expending spell slots, or similar adventuring activity, the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.",

The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character's total number of them. You regain at least 1 Hit Die when you finish a long rest."
